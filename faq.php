					<div class="panel">
						 <p>From an economic point of view, insurance is an arrangement for reducing financial risk by transferring it from a policy holder to an insurer. 
				The social aspect of insurance involves the collective bearing of losses through contributions by all members of a group to compensate for losses suffered by a few group members. 
				From a business viewpoint, insurance achieves the sharing of risk by transferring risks from individuals and businesses to financial institutions specializing in risk management. Lastly, from a legal perspective, insurance is a contract whereby, in consideration of a premium received, a person promises to make payment to another person, in case of happening of an event specified in the contract due to which second person suffers a loss. The party bearing the risk is known as the 'insurer' or 'assurer' and the party whose risk is covered is known as the 'insured' or 'assured'.

They transfer the economic risk of loss to an insurance company.

You can also open an Investor Account (IAS) directly with the CDC, where you can transfer shares from your CDC sub-account maintained with the broker for safe keeping. IAS provides extra security, as shares held in IAS account have to be moved to CDC sub-account with authorization of the account holder before they can be traded further.

						Symbol(Rating category)	                          Description*

						CCC
						CC

					</div>
                    <button class="accordion">38.	What does credit rating convey?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Credit rating is an assessment of the probability of default on payment of interest and principal on a debt instrument. It is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold a debt instrument. Rating only provides an additional input to the investor and the investor is required to make his own independent and objective analysis before arriving at an investment decision.

					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Not necessarily. In most cases, a downgrade does not mean that a default is anticipated. All it indicates is that the risk associated with the debt obligation is relatively higher than what it was before the downgrade.

					</div>
                    <button class="accordion">40.	How is credit rating done?</button>

                    <button class="accordion">43.What are investment and speculative grade ratings?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>An investment grade rating signifies the rating company’s belief that the rated instrument is likely to meet its payment obligations. In Pakistan, debt instruments rated 'BBB-' and above are classified as investment grade ratings.

						Instruments that are rated ‘BB‘ and below are classified as speculative grade category ratings in which case the ability to meet the payment obligations is considered to be “speculative”. Instruments rated in the speculative grade are considered to carry materially higher risk and a higher probability of default compared to instruments rated in the investment grade.

					</div>
                    <button class="accordion">43.	Is rating a one-time exercise?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>No. To protect the interest of investors, SECP has mandated that every credit rating company shall, during the lifetime of the securities rated by it, continuously monitor the rating of such securities and carry out periodic reviews of all published ratings.
					</p>
					</div>
                    <button class="accordion">44. Why do ratings change?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Rating is an opinion based on information available at a point in time with the rating company and expectations made on the basis of such information by the company. However, information can change significantly over time causing the rated instruments performance to deviate from the earlier expectations thereby affecting the future repayment abilities and thus, requiring the rating to be altered.</p>

					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Initial Public Offering or IPO is the first time sale of securities by a company to the public.  It is one of the modes of fund raising by the corporates from the capital market. IPOs, also known as the Primary Market bring together both the corporates that need funds and the investors who have surplus funds for investment. An IPO gives the investing public, particularly the small investors, an opportunity to own and participate in the growth of a formerly private limited company. 

					Through IPOs, the corporates can offer different securities in the form of equity, quasi equity or debt. The most common securities issued in our market are the ordinary shares.

					IPOs are made through prospectus issued, circulated and published for information of the general public separately for each IPO before commencement of the public subscription period.

					Normally, IPOs include only new shares that the issuer sells in order to raise capital. However, in some cases, shares held by existing shareholders are divested through IPOs. The proceeds from the sales by selling shareholders do not go to the Issuer and instead go to the selling shareholders. Selling shareholders may include sponsors/promoters and such other early investors seeking liquidity on their investment.

					<div class="panel">
					  <p>In the book building method, first the Floor Price (the minimum price at which bid can be made) is decided by the issuer in consultation with the Consultant to the Issue and the Book Runner. Then Strike Price (the price at which demand is raised for subscription of all the shares allocated under the book-building portion of the issue) is determined by the market forces by way of making bids through the book building system of PSX. After determination of the Strike Price all the shares allocated to the book building portion are provisionally allotted to the successful bidders and the retail investors are offered shares at the price determined through the bidding i.e. the Strike Price.

						It is noteworthy to mention here that in the bidding, only Institutional Investors and High-Net-Worth Individual Investors (the investors who make bid for an amount of not less than one million rupees.) are allowed to participate.

						(2)	Whereas in the fixed price method, offer price is set by the Issuer in consultation with the Consultant to the Issue after meeting and consultation with the potential underwriters. The underwriters are independent financial institutions and stock brokerage companies licensed or allowed by SECP to undertake underwriting of public offerings.

						(3)	From the issuer’s perspective, the higher the offering price, the more fund the Issuer can raise. The Consultant to the Issue and the Book Runner may have interest in a high price not only to meet the Issuer’s objective, but also to get high fee if it is agreed as a certain percentage of the fund raised. At the same time, the Consultant to the Issue and the Book Runner might be wishing the offer price is set at a level that is attractive for the investors, as ultimately they are responsible for concluding the IPO successfully.
